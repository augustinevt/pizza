#### Order a pizza online!

#### By August von Trapp

## Description

This small app allows a user to choose a size and add toppings to a pizza order.

## note to reviewer
  You will notice that the commits on this project are not on Friday. I tried a much more ambitious project on Friday and could not finish on time (you can see what I was attempting to make [here](https://github.com/augustinevt/logistic-pizza-app)). I made this current project because the code I wrote on Friday did not meet the basic requirements yet I am interested in continuing to explore the interesting challenges that arose while writing. Would love to talk discuss details in the review. Thank you!
